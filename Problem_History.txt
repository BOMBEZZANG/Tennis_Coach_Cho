  Summary of the Problem & Solution

  Root Cause: ScrollRect Setup Issues

  The AppointmentItem was invisible due to two critical ScrollRect configuration problems:

  Problem 1: Zero-Sized Containers

  - Viewport: width:0.00, height:0.00
  - Content: width:0.00
  - Result: Even though AppointmentItems were positioned correctly, they had no space to render in

  Problem 2: Mask Clipping

  - Viewport Mask: rect: (x:0.00, y:0.00, width:0.00, height:0.00)
  - Result: The Mask component was clipping everything because the Viewport had zero dimensions

  The Complete Fix:

  1. Fixed ScrollRect Sizing:
  // Viewport: Stretch to fill ScrollRect area
  viewportRect.anchorMin = Vector2.zero;
  viewportRect.anchorMax = Vector2.one;
  viewportRect.sizeDelta = Vector2.zero;

  // Content: Top-anchored with proper height
  contentRect.anchorMin = new Vector2(0, 1);
  contentRect.anchorMax = new Vector2(1, 1);
  contentRect.sizeDelta = new Vector2(0, 300);
  2. Disabled Problematic Mask:
  mask.enabled = false; // Temporarily disabled zero-sized mask

  How to Prevent This Issue in Future:

  1. Proper ScrollRect Setup in Unity Editor:

  - Viewport: Should stretch to fill ScrollRect (anchorMin: 0,0 to anchorMax: 1,1)
  - Content: Should be top-anchored with flexible height (anchorMin: 0,1 to anchorMax: 1,1)
  - Never leave Viewport/Content with zero dimensions

  2. ScrollRect Creation Checklist:

  ✅ ScrollRect GameObject has proper size
  ✅ Viewport child stretches to fill ScrollRect
  ✅ Content child is properly anchored (usually top-stretch)
  ✅ Mask component on Viewport has proper dimensions
  ✅ Content Size Fitter configured if using dynamic sizing

  3. Debug Process for Future UI Issues:

  1. Check GameObject active state (was ✅)
  2. Check positioning (was ✅)
  3. Check dimensions ← This was the key issue
  4. Check parent hierarchy dimensions ← Critical for ScrollRects
  5. Check Mask components ← Can clip even with proper sizing

  4. Warning Signs to Watch For:

  - Width or Height = 0 in any parent container
  - Mask components on containers with zero dimensions
  - ScrollRect Viewport not properly configured
  - Content not properly anchored for scrolling

  The items were being created perfectly, positioned correctly, and had all proper components - they just had
  nowhere to render due to the ScrollRect container setup!
