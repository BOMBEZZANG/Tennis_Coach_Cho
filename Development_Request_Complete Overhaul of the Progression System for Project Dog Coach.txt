 Development Request: Complete Overhaul of the Progression System for Project "Dog Coach"

**1. Introduction & Purpose**

This document outlines the requirements for a complete redesign of the core progression and leveling system.

As part of our project's strategic pivot from the initial "Tennis Coach" theme to the new **"Dog Agility Coach"** theme, the previous dual-level system needs to be replaced. The new structure is designed to offer greater player freedom, support more diverse playstyles, and align perfectly with the new, more narrative-rich theme.

The goal is to refactor the existing prototype's level system into this new, more robust architecture.

**2. Summary of Key Changes**

  * **System Architecture:** The old 2-track system (Coaching Level / Player Level) is now deprecated. It will be replaced by a **1 Global + 4 Specialist** track system.
  * **New Core Stat - Stamina:** A global 'Player Level' is being introduced, which is directly tied to a new core resource: **Stamina**. Stamina will be consumed by all major activities.
  * **Four Specialist Fields:** The old 'Skill' categories are being replaced by four distinct, theme-specific fields of expertise: **Handling, Behaviorism, Artisanry, and Management.**
  * **Perk System Redefined:** **Perk Points** are now the primary reward for global player level-ups. These points are a universal currency used to unlock powerful abilities within any of the four specialist skill trees.

**3. Detailed System Architecture**

**3.1. Global Player Progression: The 'Player Level & Stamina' Track**
This track represents the player character's fundamental growth and physical capacity.

  * **Experience (Player XP):** Player XP is gained from **all** major in-game activities (training, crafting, community events, etc.).
  * **Level Up Reward:** When the Player Level increases, the player receives two rewards:
    1.  **Stamina Increase:** The player's maximum Stamina is permanently increased.
    2.  **Perk Point +1:** The player gains one Perk Point to spend.
  * **Stamina:** This stat functions as the primary resource for performing actions. Most activities will consume a set amount of Stamina.

**3.2. Specialist Progression: The 'Four Pillars of Expertise'**
These are four independent skill tracks representing the coach's professional development. Each has its own XP and Level.

  * **Pillar 1: Handling (훈련 기술)**

      * **XP Source:** Actively training a dog (Agility mini-games, obedience drills).
      * **Level-Up Rewards:** Passive bonuses related to training efficiency (e.g., slightly better mini-game performance), unlocks new training modules, and unlocks new Tiers of Perks to be purchased in the Handling skill tree.

  * **Pillar 2: Behaviorism (행동 심리)**

      * **XP Source:** Correcting a dog's problem behaviors, studying books, observing dogs.
      * **Level-Up Rewards:** Passive bonuses for behavior correction, unlocks new diagnostic tools, and unlocks new Tiers of Perks in the Behaviorism skill tree.

  * **Pillar 3: Artisanry (제작 기술)**

      * **XP Source:** Crafting handmade treats, nutritional meals, and training gear.
      * **Level-Up Rewards:** Passive bonuses to crafting speed/quality, unlocks new crafting recipes, and unlocks new Tiers of Perks in the Artisanry skill tree.

  * **Pillar 4: Management & Reputation (경영/명성)**

      * **XP Source:** Participating in community events, winning competitions, managing club finances (once acquired).
      * **Level-Up Rewards:** Passive bonuses to income/reputation gain, unlocks new event opportunities, and unlocks new Tiers of Perks in the Management skill tree.

**5. Action Items for Development**

1.  **Refactor** the existing level system from the prototype.
2.  **Implement** the new global `Player Level` which tracks `Player XP` from all sources.
3.  **Implement** the new `Stamina` player stat, which is consumed by actions and increased by Player Level-ups.
4.  **Create** four new, independent XP and Level trackers for `Handling`, `Behaviorism`, `Artisanry`, and `Management`.
5.  **Connect** specific in-game activities to grant XP to both the `Player Level` and the relevant `Specialist Level` as per the flowchart.
6.  **Modify** the UI to display the Player Level, Stamina bar, and the four Specialist Levels.
7.  **Ensure** that Player Level-ups grant 1 `Perk Point`. The UI for spending these points in the four trees should be designed.

Please let me know if you have any questions or require further clarification on this new system architecture.
